# The tool

To use this tool you need Visual Studio 2017 since UWP for JS has been discontinued in 2019.

You need the Universal Platform workload.

You can grab a sample level from the release page.

Just launch the application and select the PARIS2D folder - a .3mf file will be generated inside (it can be opened with 3D Viewer)
